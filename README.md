# Snake-Game

The Snake game is a classic video game where you control a snake on a grid. The goal is to eat food to make the snake longer. The game ends if the snake hits the boundaries or itself. It's a great project for beginners to learn game development in Python, involving concepts like loops, user input, collision detection, and basic graphics.
